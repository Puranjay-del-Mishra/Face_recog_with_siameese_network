# Face_recog_with_siameese_network
Face recognition algorithm using vggface2 pretrained weights and inceptionresnetV1(imported from facenet-pytorch)
I chose the value of alpha by manual testing.
It failed to recognize me when i was bald vs the picture where i have lots of hair.
It also failed on a test case where it gave a false positive to my identical twin's picture.
